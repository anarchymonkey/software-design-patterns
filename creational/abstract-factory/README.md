In this example, we define an interface `GUIFactory` for creating abstract products `Button` and `Checkbox`. We then define two concrete factory types `WindowsGUIFactory` and `MacGUIFactory` that implement the `GUIFactory` interface to create Windows and Mac style products respectively.

We also define abstract product interfaces Button and Checkbox and their concrete implementations `WindowsButton, MacButton, WindowsCheckbox, and MacCheckbox`.

Finally, in the client code, we create instances of `WindowsGUIFactory` and `MacGUIFactory` and use them to create `Button` and `Checkbox` products. The `Paint() `method is then called on each of the products to display their respective styles.

Overall, the abstract factory pattern in Golang allows for easy creation of related product families, with the ability to switch between different product implementations without affecting the client code.
